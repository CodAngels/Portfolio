        <h2>Brief Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a mobile accountability app that allows you to make plans with your friends
            and ensures you both follow through with<br> the plans by depositing an equal amount to
            a central account.
            If both of you follow through with the plans, the amount goes into <br> the food/beverage 
            expenses of your plans.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, if one of the parties cancels without a 24hr notice,
            they forfeit the amount they deposited as an inconvenience fee <br>for the other party with
            the service taking a percentage cut.</p><br>

           <p>Make plans and don't get disappointed or get a consolation fee for the inconvenience!
