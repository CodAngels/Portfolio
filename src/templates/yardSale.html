        <h2>Brief Description</h2>
        <p>Every Spring semester, seniors spam college emails with numerous powerpoints of things
            they plan to sell and the prices they charge. However, these powerpoints are just sent
            to the house's emailing list and there is no central way to manage the sold items, the
            offers received and the sold items.
        </p>
        <p>
            yardSale is a centralised platform that makes it easy to connect seniors selling their
            items with others students willing to buy the items. The items are no longer restricted
            to a single house but the whole school. It also utilizes a bid system where a seller can
            receive multiple bids for the same item. It also tracks what bids have been accepted and 
            delivered.

            No more powerpoints, no more spamming, <br>
            Just snap a picture, a short description and get bids!
