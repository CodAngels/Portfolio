                <p>Hello!</p>
                    <p>My name is Roy. I am a rising senior at Harvard University concentrating in Computer Science. I am passionate
                about human computer interactions and the purposeful design of concepts with users in mind.</p><br>
                <p>I have previously interned at Amazon as a Software Development Intern with their devices team in Sunnyvale, California.
                I also participated remotely in the Meta Data Challenge Finalist on data analysis.</p>
                <br>
                <p>     Currently, I am working on a personal project, <a href="yardSale.html">YardSale</a>, that aims to connect graduating senior
                students looking to sell their belongings before graduatin with current students looking to buy. This saves the seniors the 
                much needed time to prepare for one of the most important moments of their lives.</p><br><p> I am concurrently working on other projects
                either individually or collaboratively.</p>
